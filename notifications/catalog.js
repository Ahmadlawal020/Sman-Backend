/**
 * The notification catalog — every kind of notification the platform can send,
 * declared in one file.
 *
 * An entry answers five questions and nothing else:
 *
 *   who is it for   → `audience` ("customer" | "staff")
 *   what is it about→ `category` (the unit preferences are expressed in)
 *   how loud is it  → `priority` (drives quiet-hours suppression)
 *   where does it go→ `channels` (the DEFAULT set; preferences narrow it)
 *   what does it say→ `title` / `body`, plus optional per-channel overrides
 *
 * Business code never writes copy. It calls
 * `notify("order.released", { recipient, data })` and the wording, the routing
 * and the deep link are decided here. That is what makes it possible to change
 * an SMS, add push to a flow, or mute a whole category without touching a
 * controller.
 *
 * DATA CONTRACT: each entry documents the `data` fields its templates read.
 * Templates must tolerate missing fields — an event emitted from a code path
 * that forgot a field should degrade to a vaguer sentence, never throw, because
 * a template crash would take out the notification AND everything queued
 * behind it.
