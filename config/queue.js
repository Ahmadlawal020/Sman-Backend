/**
 * The durable job queue — pg-boss, jobs as Postgres rows in the `pgboss`
 * schema. Chosen over Redis/BullMQ deliberately: no second datastore, the
 * existing backups cover the queue, and at fuel-order volume (hundreds of
 * messages a day) a dedicated broker is capacity nobody would use. pg-boss
 * polls — it never needs LISTEN/NOTIFY — so it runs fine through Neon's
 * pooled connection; set PGBOSS_DATABASE_URL to a direct (non-pooled) string
 * if maintenance chatter should bypass the pooler.
 *
 * Why a queue at all: a Meta webhook payload that isn't persisted is
 * unrecoverable (no replay API — retries stop after ~7 days), and Cloud API
 * sends need retry with backoff somewhere a failure is visible. Both are
 * durability problems, and durability lives in the database here.
