/* --- FLAGGED — the gate/release/ticketing flow below has NOT been migrated
 * to the live schema, and needs its own dedicated pass, not a quick
 * find-and-replace. releaseOrder's truck allocation, gateInTruck,
 * markTruckLoaded, gateOutTruck, generateOrderTickets and
 * getTruckTicketPrintData all still write/read orderTruckRepo
 * (consumer_truckallocation) using vocabulary that table no longer has:
 * truckIndex (-> truckNumber), truckNumber-as-plate (-> plateNumber),
 * truckId (dropped, no live column), driverPhone (dropped, no live column),
 * a generic status field using gated_in/gated_out/loaded (-> ticketStatus,
 * whose real enum is pending/generated/printed/loaded/completed — gated_in/
 * gated_out don't exist in it at all). ticketNumber (NOT NULL UNIQUE,
 * app-generated — see order.service.js's truckAllocationTicketNumber) and
 * orderProductId (NOT NULL FK) are never supplied at any of this file's
 * orderTruckRepo.create() call sites, so every one of those inserts would
 * violate a live constraint as written today.
 *
 * More fundamentally: consumer_truckallocation has NO gate-tracking columns
 * at all (no securityEnteredAt/By, securityExitedAt/By, loadedAt/By, gantry,
 * loaderName, entryDriverName/Phone) — those all live on the SEPARATE
 * consumer_truckticket table (see repositories/ticket.repository.js and
 * services/ticket.service.js's generateTicketForTruck), created explicitly
 * per Django's own TruckTicket docstring ("created after an order is
 * released... generated explicitly by an admin via the generate-tickets
 * endpoint"). The real fix is architectural, not a rename: gate-in/load/
 * gate-out should read and write consumer_truckticket rows (via ticketRepo),
 * with orderTruckRepo/consumer_truckallocation staying scoped to what it
 * actually is live — the order-time truck manifest, nothing past it.
 *
 * Deliberately not attempted in this pass — it touches release, gate
 * security and depot loading simultaneously, each with its own operational
 * risk, and deserves focused verification against the sandbox on its own,
 * the same way placeOrder/payOrder/orderStatus.service.js got theirs. Every
 * function in this file from releaseOrder's truck-allocation loop onward
 * should be treated as broken against the live schema until that pass
 * happens.

//   gate-out  (security_exit)  gated_in → gated_out ; last truck  ⇒ Loading→Completed
//
// `pending` is the odd one out: it is a fleet allocation captured at release
// before its ticket exists. Ticketing turns it `loaded`; it may also be gated
// in as-is, and the exit stamps the loading it never got.
//
// The separate `load` (ticketing) endpoint is what remains of a third
// checkpoint. Nothing in the flow needs it now — it stays as the correction
// desk for a truck swapped at the gantry, where the plate on the ticket must
// change after the ticket was cut.
//
// Every action locks the ORDER row first (orderRepo.lockById), so concurrent
// trucks on the same order serialise: exactly one sees the "first in" / "last
// out" edge and drives the order transition; the others skip it. Each load's
// own status guard makes an out-of-order or repeated action a clean 409.
