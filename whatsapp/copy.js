/**
 * Every customer-facing string the engine can say, in one reviewable module.

 *
 * Tone (agreed): formal and professional. No emojis, no dashes. Every
 * message should read clearly regardless of the reader's background.
 *
 * Support contact arrives as a variable (from SUPPORT_PHONE config) so no
